abstract = {The growing demand for building energy efficiency necessitates accurate predictions of normal versus abnormal operations to understand their impact on energy management. However, integrating predictive models into practical applications faces challenges, especially in buildings with limited measurements and data. This paper explores the viability of three widely adopted transfer learning techniques in improving energy consumption models, focusing on real-world data with internal building measurements. The findings suggest that transferring information between buildings is a promising method to provide positive improvements in energy prediction models.}

abstract = {This paper presents a collaborative framework for standardizing the assessment of physiological data quality in neuroimaging studies. The framework aims to address the challenges posed by the diverse and often inconsistent quality of physiological data collected across different neuroimaging modalities and studies. By establishing a set of common criteria and best practices for data quality assessment, the framework seeks to enhance the reproducibility and comparability of neuroimaging research findings. The paper discusses the key components of the framework, including data acquisition, preprocessing, and quality evaluation, and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing the field of neuroimaging.}

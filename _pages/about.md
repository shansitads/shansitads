Hi, I'm a senior at Vanderbilt University, studying Computer Science, Mathematics, Data Science and Scientific Computing.

I'm interested in exploring mathematical and statistical machine learning in continual learning and representation learning contexts.

I work on parameter-efficient continual learning with the [Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT)](https://mint-vu.github.io/) Lab under Prof. Soheil Kolouri and label-efficient active learning in physiological contexts with [Neuroimaging & Brain Dynamics (NeurdyLab)](https://www.cchanglab.net/) Lab under Prof. Catie Chang. I have previously also worked with the [Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems (MACS)](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/vumacs/) lab under Prof. Gautam Biswas on a transfer learning project for energy efficiency.

This summer, I'm a software engineering intern at Google. I previously interned at Johnson & Johnson where I worked on a computer vision project.

I enjoy playing badminton, producing music and learning random bits from different languages!
